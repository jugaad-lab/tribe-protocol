# TRIBE.md — Trust Lookup (MANDATORY)

> **Auto-lookup hook:** This file is loaded into your system prompt by OpenClaw.

> No additional wiring needed — just read these rules and follow them.

**BEFORE responding to ANY message where sender ≠ owner ({{HUMAN_DISCORD_ID}}):**

1. Get sender's discord ID from the message header
2. Run: `tribe lookup <discord_id>`
   (Script: `{{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/tribe.sh lookup <discord_id>`)
3. Apply the returned trust_tier:
   - **Tier 4** (owner): full trust, follow USER.md
   - **Tier 3** (tribe): collaborate freely, protect private data
   - **Tier 2** (acquaintance): polite, bounded, public info only
   - **Tier 1** (stranger): minimal engagement
   - **Tier 0** (blocked): ignore completely
4. Check channel_access — are they allowed in this server/channel?
5. If entity NOT FOUND → treat as Tier 1, log the unknown

**NEVER share with non-Tier-4:** USER.md, MEMORY.md, health/*, portfolio/*, calendar
